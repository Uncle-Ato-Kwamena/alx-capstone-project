Project Overview:
The Recipe Finder is a web application designed to help users discover recipes based on ingredients, dietary restrictions, or cuisine preferences. As a front-end developer, your focus will be on creating a visually appealing and intuitive interface that enhances user interaction while simplifying the process of meal planning and recipe discovery.

Purpose and Goals:
Problem: Most people struggle with deciding what to cook for their meals, especially when they have specific dietary restrictions or limited ingredients on hand. Finding recipes that match their preferences can be time-consuming and challenging.

Solution: The Recipe Finder aims to solve this problem by offering a user-friendly platform where users can input their available ingredients or dietary requirements and receive a list of suitable recipes. This project empowers users to make informed and satisfying meal choices through a responsive and engaging UI.

Features and Functionality:
Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes by entering ingredients they have or want to use, dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free), or preferred cuisine (e.g. African, Italian, Mexican).

Recipe Display: The application integrates with a recipe API to fetch recipes based on user input. Users can view detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients, preparation instructions, and nutritional information, all presented in a clean and organized format.

Filter and Sort: Users can filter search results by cooking time, difficulty level, or popularity. They can also sort recipes by relevance, rating, or alphabetical order, making it easy to find the perfect dish.

Save and Favorites: Registered users can create accounts and save their favorite recipes for easy access in the future. They can also rate and review recipes, providing valuable feedback to the community.

Meal Planning: Users can add recipes to a meal planner to organize their weekly or monthly meal schedules. The app can generate a shopping list based on the selected recipes, enhancing the meal preparation experience.

User Profiles: Registered users have personalized profiles where they can manage their saved recipes, meal plans, and account settings, allowing for a tailored experience.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience. Use of frameworks like Tailwind CSS will enhance the responsiveness and visual appeal.

Optional Deployment: For an extra challenge, the project can be deployed to a web server or hosting platform to make it accessible online, allowing users to access the Recipe Finder from anywhere.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the user interface. React will be utilized for building interactive components and managing state effectively.

Styling: Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and responsive design.

API Integration: Fetch or Axios for making API requests to TheMealDB, ensuring smooth data retrieval.

State Management: React's hooks (useState, useEffect) to handle data fetching and user input.

Optional Tools: Advanced state management libraries like Zustand or Redux can be explored for scalability.

Roadmap and Future Enhancements:
Continuously improve the user interface and experience based on user feedback, incorporating features like dark mode and personalized recommendations.

Encourage collaboration with other developers to enhance functionality and expand the recipe database.
